## How to add a new package?

1. Clone this repository
2. Use one of the built-in templates to get started (alternatively add `packages/<new-package>` files manually):

   ```sh
   npm install
   npx yo @twoday/twoday
   ```

3. If the package has files to be deployed to GitHub Pages, add paths to [ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml#L45)
4. When you are ready to publish, run `npx changeset` and follow the instructions, then create a pull request. CI will publish a new version from the main branch according to the changeset.

## Package guidelines

- Make sure there is not already a package for the same purpose. Really, there are packages for almost everything on npm.
- Keep the number of features small. A small package is more composable and usually has more real world use cases, then a package that does multiple things.

  > Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

  > ‚Äî Antoine de Saint-Exupery

- For other than tools, always use TypeScript or add types manually

### Naming

- Every package must use the `@twoday` scope
- If the package is for a specific technology, prefix with that. Examples:
  - `@twoday/react-foo`
  - `@twoday/babel-preset-bar`
  - `@twoday/angular-baz`
  - `@twoday/mui-qux`
- If the package is an integration between external packages, list names alphabetically, join using kebab case, and suffix with `-integration`. Example:
  - `@twoday/msw-openapi-backend-integration`

### Versioning

Follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Also, it is recommended:

- `0.1.0` to be the **first release**
- For the first year keep versions in the `0.y.z` range, where **y**: breaking changes, **z**: other changes
- Release `1.0.0` 1 year after the first release, regardless of the change. This ensures the public API has time to be defined, and the package won't stay years in the initial development phase.
- For breaking changes use [React‚Äôs approach](https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/02/19/new-versioning-scheme.html#breaking-changes). In short:
  1. In a **minor** version update:
     - Introduce new APIs and breaking changes using a different name, example `next_someFunction`
     - Deprecate `someFunction`
  2. In a **major** version update:
     - Rename `next_someFunction` to `someFunction` (keep `next_someFunction` available too)
     - Deprecate `next_someFunction`
  - Benefits:
    - Functionality can be changed within one major version bump üëç
    - Users can always upgrade to the next major version, if they have first upgraded to latest minor version and are not using deprecated APIs üëç

### Readme

README.md is required. If applicable, readme should include at least a usage example and documentation of the public API.

Install instructions or other general information should not be included, unless there is something special to mention.

### Changelog

Include a CHANGELOG.md file ([example](/packages/react-app-locale-utils/CHANGELOG.md)).

### Tests

`package.json` may have a `test` script. CI makes sure tests are passed before publishing.
